    <h2>How to play</h2>
    <p id=intro>Minesweeper is a simple game where the goal is to map out a field where mines are located, flagging the mines and digging where it is safe. Once the whole minefield has been dug up or marked correctly, you win! If you make a mistake and accidentally dig up a mine, the game ends. The instructions for the game will pop up when you begin, and you can select a difficulty level for playing. Good luck!</p>
